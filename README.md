# Mamba-based Decoder-Only Approach with Bidirectional Speech Modeling for Speech Recognition

This repository is for Mamba-based decoder-only approach (MADEON) for speech recognition proposed in the following paper:
```

  author    =  {Masuyama, Yoshiki and Miyazaki, Koichi and Murata, Masato},
  title     =  {Mamba-based Decoder-Only Approach with Bidirectional Speech Modeling for Speech Recognition},
  booktitle =  {Proc. IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)},
  year      =  2024,

}
```

Our implementation highly relies on [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet).
We will add our training and inference scripts soon.
